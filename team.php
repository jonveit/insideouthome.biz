				<h3>Shantih Brando</h3>
				<p><img src="img/people/shantih.jpg" alt="Shantih Brando" class="pull-right team-image" />Shantih is a transplant from New York, living in Mt. Airy with her husband Dan Taylor and their four kids.  Shantih started InsideOut five years ago when she saw the need for affordable home staging services in the local real estate market. Her interior design aesthetic - inspired by the ancient Chinese practice of Feng Shui - is about creating space and light. Coming from a family of florists in Brooklyn, Shantih believes strongly in the power of horticulture to beautify and complement a home. She recently completed the Landscape Design Series at the Morris Arboretum and enjoys sprucing up the Curb Appeal on the InsideOut projects!Â  </p>

Airy where she and her partner, Ben, are raising her two sons and his two daughters. Never one to shy away from a home improvement project, Mia joined InsideOut as springboard to a career in real estate. Her love for Philadelphia and it's architecture are her inspiration to help homeowners present their homes in the most beautiful and elegant manner possible.</p>
