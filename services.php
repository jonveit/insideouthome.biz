		                	<span><strong>General Contract Services</strong></span>
		                	<p>Inside/Out can manage any renovations necessary in a house before it lists, such as painting, basement water-proofing, powder room &amp; kitchen updates, deep-cleaning, floor refinishing and carpet replacement, among others. </p>
		                	<span><strong>Storage Options</strong></span>
		                  	<p> Inside/Out can procure a convenient storage unit, and handle the packing, boxing & the move. Less is more when presenting a home for sale; more than half of most people's belongings usually need to be stored, and if basement or closet space is limited, an off-site storage unit is key.</p>
