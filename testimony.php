					<p>  I would absolutely recommend Inside/Out to any friends or neighbors who are preparing their house to sell.  Shantih Brando tells you what you need to hear--what rooms need repainting, what areas need a little work.  You may not want to hear it, but she's giving you the objective view of the buyers out there.  The work of Shantih and her team made our house attractive to buyers, and we received extremely strong offfers for purchase in the first week of showing the house.  This would not have been possible without Shantih and Inside/Out!</p><p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20px">Sue-Im Lee</p></div><div class="testimony">
                  <p>  Shantih, <br /> <br />Thank you again for the <em> fantastic </em> job that you did helping us move.  You and your team were incredible.  From clearing out our old large house to helping us get settled in our smaller temporary rental you made a very difficult job more bearable.  Your sensitivity to our needs and your willingness to do anything and everything that had to be done was amazing.  And you always did it with a smile.   It was a big job and we literally could not have done it without you. This is the second job we have done together and we will be using InsideOut again, when we move from this temporary spot to our permanent home.  I could not recommend InsideOut more highly.  You are a high quality company and even higher quality people. Thank you again! </p><p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 20px"> Neil Heller </p></div><div class="testimony">
                  <p> Shantih Brando and Inside/Out Home Solutions was the saving grace to me and my family in the process of helping my parents move from a house they had lived in for over 50 years.  Shantih lead us through the entire process from "decluttering" to sale of the house.  In additional to the incredible job (and I mean incredible!) she did in transforming the house as we prepared it for sale, her sensitive and compassionate manner in working with all of us provided great comfort in knowing we were in the best of hands.  Major kudos to Shantih and all the folks that she worked with throughout this process, we cannot thank you enough.</p>

              	<p> Shantih staged our entire home for sale and we could not have asked for a more incredible designer. We credit Shantih for our house selling in five days despite the terrible market. We moved out and took all of our furniture, and Shantih moved in with furniture for the house from top to bottom. When we walked into each room, we felt like we were on a design television show as we screamed in disbelief at the dramatic change in each room. Our house was stunning, trendy, and enchanting. Shantih is clearly passionate about her work and often arrived at 6:00a.m. to put in as much time as possible. We highly recommend Shantih to anyone who is selling their home, or wants to redesign their house into something amazing.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 20px">Leona and Scott Goldshaw</p></div><div class="testimony">
			  	<br /><p> Inside/Out totally transformed our house when we put it on the market  The pictures are magazine quality and attracted showings right away. Shantih and Penka are easy to work with and made the entire moving and selling process less stressful and actually a lot of fun!</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 20px">Rachel Levine</p> </div><div class="testimony">
				<br /><p> Inside/Out transformed the whole moving process for me. We had 3700 sq. feet of space to stage. Shantih and Penka’s high energy, attention to detail and creative vision for my house took an overwhelming task and made it manageable, even fun. What’s more, I appreciated how affordable and environmentally conscious they were.  It gave me a sense of peace in an otherwise turbulent time.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 20px">Heather Hill </p></div><div class="testimony">
				<br /><p> Shantih and Penka arrived in a flurry had our house in order and ready to be put on the market in no time. It is a pleasure to live in as we await the right buyer and is a breeze to keep show ready, especially with two small children. We literally didn't have to lift a finger as they took care of everything, even moving unneeded furniture and boxes to our off site storage unit.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-right: 20px">Chuck Smith</p></div>
